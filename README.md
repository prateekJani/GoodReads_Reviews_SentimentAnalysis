In this Project, we are extracting reviews and ratings of the books from the json file which we have downloaded which will be stored in a .txt file for easy access. After extracting the data as good and bad based on the ratings given to the reviews we will spilt both of the text files in 75:25 ratio to store it in train.txt and test.txt files to train and test the model to carryout out main task i.e sentiment analysis.

There are two files, one is named as goodReads.py where the main code is present to execute all the tasks linearly and the other one is .ipynb where the testing is done to make sure every task is being executed properly giving the right output with no errors.
